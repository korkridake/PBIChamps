# Power BI Licensing 2021

What a user can do in the Power BI service depends on the type of per-user license that they have. The level of access provided by their license depends on whether the workspace being accessed is in a Premium workspace or not. All users of the Power BI service must have a license.

There are two ways for users to get a license. Using self-service sign-up capabilities and their work or school account, users can get their own free, Pro, or Premium Per User license. Or, admins can get a Power BI license subscription and assign licenses to users.
